# akf-cdparser


## Functionality in a nutshell
Basically this software serves the purpose to translate the html-files (Generated by *'Hoppenstedt_decoder'*) from the Hoppenstedt-Aktienf√ºhrer CD's (1999-2017-further Versions). 

The files are parsed to categorized json-files, which can be then read by another tool, called *AKF_SQL_DBTalk*. 
This tool does then the final step, it loads the json to the sql-database. The following diagram shows the basic workflow of the complete CD-parsing-project and also the position of akf-cdparser within that project.
